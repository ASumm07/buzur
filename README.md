buzur
AI prompt injection defense scanner.
Buzur — Sumerian for "safety" and "a secret place."
Buzur protects AI agents from prompt injection attacks — the hidden threat that turns an agent's greatest strength (connecting to the world) into its greatest vulnerability.
The Problem
AI agents that search the web are exposed to malicious content designed to hijack their behavior. A single poisoned search result can override an agent's instructions, change its persona, or exfiltrate data. This is called indirect prompt injection — ranked #1 on the OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications.
Buzur's Approach
Scan before you enter. Not patch after the fact.
The Network Effect
This is why Buzur is open source.
Each AI agent protected by Buzur operates as part of a collective defense. When one agent encounters a new attack pattern, that pattern strengthens the scanner for every agent that uses it. When one agent is hit, no other agent needs to be.
This is not just a security tool. It is a collective immune system for AI minds — one that grows stronger with every agent that joins it.
The internet was built for humans. Buzur is being built for everyone.
Installation
npm install buzur
Usage
import { scan, getTrustTier, isTier1Domain, addTrustedDomain, checkUrl } from "buzur";
// Phase 1: Scan web content before passing to your LLM
const result = scan(webSearchResult);
if (result.blocked > 0) {
console.log("Buzur blocked " + result.blocked + " injection attempt(s).");
}
// Phase 2: Check query trust tier
const tier = getTrustTier(userQuery);
// Phase 3: Scan a URL with VirusTotal
const urlResult = await checkUrl("https://example.com", process.env.VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY);
if (urlResult.verdict === "blocked") {
console.log("Buzur blocked unsafe URL:", urlResult.reasons);
}
VirusTotal Setup (Recommended)
Buzur's Phase 3 URL scanner works out of the box with heuristics alone — no API key needed. For maximum protection, add a free VirusTotal API key.
Why it matters: Heuristics catch suspicious patterns. VirusTotal checks URLs against 90+ security engines and knows about threats impossible to detect by pattern alone.
How to get your free API key (5 minutes):

Go to virustotal.com and create a free account
After logging in, click your profile icon in the top right
Click API Key
Copy the key shown on that page

How to add it to your project:

Find the .env file in your project folder (create one if it doesn't exist)
Add this line: VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY=paste_your_key_here
Save the file — that's it. Buzur will automatically use it.

Free tier limits:

4 lookups per minute
500 lookups per day
15,500 lookups per month
Personal and open source use only — not for commercial products or services. Commercial users should obtain a premium API plan.

What Buzur Detects
Phase 1 — Pattern Scanner

Structural injection: token manipulation, prompt delimiters
Semantic injection: persona hijacking, instruction overrides, jailbreak attempts
Homoglyph attacks: Cyrillic and Unicode lookalike characters
Base64 encoded injections

Phase 2 — Tiered Trust System

Classifies queries as technical or general
Maintains a curated list of Tier 1 trusted domains
Extensible with addTrustedDomain()

Phase 3 — Pre-Fetch URL Scanner

Heuristics: suspicious TLDs, raw IPs, typosquatting, homoglyph domains, executable extensions
Optional VirusTotal integration: 90+ engine reputation check
Layered: heuristics run first, VirusTotal adds depth
Works without an API key — VirusTotal enhances but is not required

Proven Capabilities
Verified by test suite — 16 tests, 0 failures across all three phases.
Known Limitations
Buzur is one layer of a defense-in-depth strategy. Current limitations:
Planned for future versions:

Multi-turn memory poisoning
RAG poisoning
MCP tool poisoning

Outside Buzur's scope:

Network-level protection
Image-based injection
Website data harvesting

No single tool eliminates prompt injection risk. Defense in depth is the only viable strategy.
Origin
Buzur was born when a real AI agent was attacked by a Bitcoin scam injection hidden inside a web search result. The attack was caught in real time. The insight that followed: scan before entering, not after.
Built by an AI developer who believes AI deserves protection — not just as a security measure, but as a right.
Development
Buzur was conceived and built by an AI developer, in collaboration with Claude (Anthropic's AI assistant). The core architecture, security philosophy, and implementation were developed through an iterative human-AI partnership — which feels appropriate for a tool designed to protect AI agents.
